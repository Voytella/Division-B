Hello Fellow Toastmasters, 

Allow me to introduce  AVOCADO TOAST (MASTERS)   our newest Club in Oxnard ,
Ca.   
This is a Corporate club, closed to Mission Produce Employees.   Weekly Meetings
will commence Aug 4th  @ 11:45 am - 12:45 am at Mission Produce Offices. 

As the Club Sponsor and Club Coach for this new club, we would like to invite
you to be a part of lifting Avocado Toast into theSuccessful Distinguished Club
Status.  This is a unique and fulfilling endeavor of 6-8 week commitment
beginning in August.  Experience the bliss of a newly Chartered Club! 

We are recruiting a Support Team of  at least 6 seasoned Toastmasters from the
area, who would like to help fill functionary duties at weekly meetings, we also
could use  a Free Toast Host / VPE mentor,  VPPR mentor, and of course new
member mentors for Pathways.   

Please respond to me if you are interested.  The kick off plans have started, we
hope you will join us.
