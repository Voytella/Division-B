If any of your Club Officers missed the District 33 Club Officer Training,
please be sure to have them attend a training offered by another District. Any
Club Officers that attend training outside of District 33 need to ask that
District's Program Quality Director (PQD) to email our PQD, Tan Pham (pqd@d33tm.org).
