# Expectations for Area Directors

Area Directors play a vital role in keeping District Leadership appraised of the
situation regarding the District's clubs; they act as liaisons between
individual clubs and the District Leadership. In order to satisfactorily perform
this role, Area Directors are expected to regularly communicate with both their
clubs and their Division Director.

## Club Visits

Area Directors are expected to visit each of their clubs at least twice during
their tenure: once during the first half of the year and once during the second
half. The product of these required visits is a Club Visit Report, which records
the Area Director's assessment of the health of the visited club.

## Club Status Reports

District Leaders have a monthly meeting where the status of each Division is
reported. Each month, the Area Directors are responsible for providing their
Division Director with information pertaining to the status of their clubs.

## Division Meetings

Once a quarter, the Area Directors will all meet with the Division Director to
discuss the status, health, and needs of their clubs. The Division Director will
also relay any information, initiatives, or resources from the District.

_TODO: work with Area Directors to determine dates ahead of time_
