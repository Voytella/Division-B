# Copy a file or folder from one Drive to another.

## Overview

This document describes how to copy a folder from one Google Drive into
another. The folder to be copied is downloaded from the original Google Drive
onto your local computer, where it is then uploaded into the new Google
Drive. This process is what's known as a "hard copy", meaning the two copies are
completely independent of one another; modifying one will not affect the other.
