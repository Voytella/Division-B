### Note From the District

The Distinguished Club Program goal 9a requires four club officers to be trained
between June 1, 2022 and August 31, 2022. In order to earn Goal 9, both Round 1
and Round 2 require at least 4 officers trained.

Our District 33 Goal is ALL 7 officers trained. A 100% Club Officer Trained Pink
Ribbon will be given to each club that trains all 7 officers.
